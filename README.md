<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

After the 2014 killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, The Washington Post has started to collect a database of every fatal shooting in the US by a police officer in the line of duty. The protest movement, Black Lives Matter has increased focus on police accountability. This data includes information about the deceased including race, age, gender, if they were armed, mental health, fleeing and location. The post does not track deaths of people in police custody, non-shooting deaths, or by off-duty police. They aim to document conditions most like the Michael Brown in Ferguson. Centers for Disease control and FBI track fatal shootings by police, but according to Washington Post their data is incomplete. There has not been much dependable data around shootings by police before this movement and I would like to understand the current trends among fatal police shootings.  

After the fatal shooting in 2014 waves of public protest broke out and lead to the movement of Black Lives Matter. I aim to look at the Washington Post data to see if there are trends that show signs of biases.
